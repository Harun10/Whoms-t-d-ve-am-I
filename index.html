      <p>My name is Harun Dizdarevic, and I'm from <a href="https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Bosnia-and-Herz.jpg" target=_blank>Bosnia</a>
         it's a little place in eastern Europe, in Bosnia I lied most of my life in a small city called Prijedor.
         Some of my favorite cultural foods are,

        I like to play video games, and enjoy occasionally playing basketball. My subjects
        in school are currently english, and science, but last year I had a 93% in math.
        I currently have everything 10-1 exept for math where I have 10CAP, which is a lot
        harder than I thought it would be. I'm so far enjoying the schoolyear, because
        I've made new friends, and have classes with old ones from junior high. We don't
        have, any cultural celebrations only religious because, I come from a muslim family.
        We celebrate Eid mainly, and sometimes fast.</p>

      In the future I hope to become a biomedical engineer. In order to get accepted into
      NAIT's program for biomedical enginneering I need to finish any math 30 course, and
      have either physics, or chemistry 30, and have 5 other courses above 80%. If I don't
      enjoy the course i'll try to find something that I enjoy. I would also like to get a
      PHD because, I like the idea of people calling me doctor.</p>
